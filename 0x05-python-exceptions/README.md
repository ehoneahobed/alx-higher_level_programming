# Solution to tasks on 0x05. Python - Exceptions

## Task 0:  Safe list printing
Write a function that prints x elements of a list.

- Prototype: def safe_print_list(my_list=[], x=0):
- my_list can contain any type (integer, string, etc.)
- All elements must be printed on the same line followed by a new line.
- x represents the number of elements to print
- x can be bigger than the length of my_list
- Returns the real number of elements printed
- You have to use try: / except:
- You are not allowed to import any module
- You are not allowed to use len()

## Task 1. Safe printing of an integers list
Write a function that prints an integer with "{:d}".format().

- Prototype: def safe_print_integer(value):
- value can be any type (integer, string, etc.)
- The integer should be printed followed by a new line
- Returns True if value has been correctly printed (it means the value is an integer)
- Otherwise, returns False
- You have to use try: / except:
- You have to use "{:d}".format() to print as integer
- You are not allowed to import any module
- You are not allowed to use type()
